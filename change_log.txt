- Added the Store New Entry ID setting to the New Entry step settings.
- Added the gravityflowformconnector_update_entry_id filter to allow the target entry ID to be modified.
  Example:
  add_filter( 'gravityflowformconnector_update_entry_id', 'sh_gravityflowformconnector_update_entry_id', 10, 4);
  function sh_gravityflowformconnector_update_entry_id( $target_entry_id, $entry, $form, $step ) {
      // Custom search for the target entry ID based on the value of field ID 4.
      $search_criteria['status'] = 'active';
      $search_criteria['field_filters'][] = array( 'key' => '2', 'value' => $entry['4'] );
      $entries = GFAPI::get_entries( $form['id'], $search_criteria );
      // Return the ID of the first entry in the results.
      return $entries[0]['id'];
  }
- Fixed an issue with the approval action of the Update Entry Step for entries created with the New Entry step.
- Fixed an issue with the field mappings which may affect some forms.
- Fixed an issue with the update step when triggered by a schedule or the expiration of a previous step where the approval or user input action does not complete.
- Fixed an issue with the update step where remote approvals can fail on some servers. Requires Gravity Flow 1.6.2-dev+.
